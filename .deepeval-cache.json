Brief Hospital Course:___ Female with PMH significant for depression, hyperlipidemia, Hysterectomy, B12 deficiency, OA, carcinoid, cervical DJD, depression, SBO who presented with nausea, vomiting, weakness x 2 weeks and was found to have multiple liver and lung masses per CT consistent with metastatic cancer of unknown primary. Patient was treated with IV fluids overnight for dehydration. She refused to stay in the hospital for any further work-up or treatment and stated she would rather go home to to think and see to her affairs over the weekend and consider pursuing further work-up as an outpatient. She tolerated oral fluids well w/o vomiting. She remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile throughout her stay. Of note patient has psychiatric history of depressive symptoms and isolation tendencies. She denied any SI/SA or any risk to herself. She has little social supports but does have a good relationship with her driver and friend who came in and was updated by the medical team on the morning of discharge and will be taking her home. She sees a mental health provider at ___ once a month and has a good relationship with her primary care physician. Patient was dischaerged home at her request. Home medications were continued to which we added some symptomatic treatment for her cough with benzonatate and Guaifenesin. We held off on anti-emetics for now as she did not want to stay inhouse to make sure these would be well tolerated (would need to monitor for drug interactions given multiple QTc prolonging and serotonergic medications on her home meds). She was instructed to maintain good hydration and try a soft diet at home if she can not tolerate regular diet. The patient met with SW who provided her with resources for community councelling. Outpatient appointments with oncology, GI and her PCP were set up and her PCP and mental health provider were updated. Her PCP ___ also ___ with her later today by telephone.

Brief Hospital Course:___ Female with PMH significant for depression, hyperlipidemia, Hysterectomy, B12 deficiency, OA, carcinoid, cervical DJD, depression, SBO who presented with nausea, vomiting, weakness x 2 weeks and was found to have multiple liver and lung masses per CT consistent with metastatic cancer of unknown primary. Patient was treated with IV fluids overnight for dehydration. She refused to stay in the hospital for any further work-up or treatment and stated she would rather go home to to think and see to her affairs over the weekend and consider pursuing further work-up as an outpatient. She tolerated oral fluids well w/o vomiting. She remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile throughout her stay. Of note patient has psychiatric history of depressive symptoms and isolation tendencies. She denied any SI/SA or any risk to herself. She has little social supports but does have a good relationship with her driver and friend who came in and was updated by the medical team on the morning of discharge and will be taking her home. She sees a mental health provider at ___ once a month and has a good relationship with her primary care physician. Patient was dischaerged home at her request. Home medications were continued to which we added some symptomatic treatment for her cough with benzonatate and Guaifenesin. We held off on anti-emetics for now as she did not want to stay inhouse to make sure these would be well tolerated (would need to monitor for drug interactions given multiple QTc prolonging and serotonergic medications on her home meds). She was instructed to maintain good hydration and try a soft diet at home if she can not tolerate regular diet. The patient met with SW who provided her with resources for community councelling. Outpatient appointments with oncology, GI and her PCP were set up and her PCP and mental health provider were updated. Her PCP ___ also ___ with her later today by telephone.
